* openbsd-ldapd

This is a very simple and practical LDAP server that was extracted
from the OpenBSD sources to be trialed on non-OpenBSD systems.

The original sources were checked out using =git-cvsimport= as
follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cvs -qd anoncvs@anoncvs.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs get -P src/usr.sbin/ldapd
  cd src/usr.sbin/ldapd
  git cvsimport
#+END_SRC

This import happened on <2017-03-08 Wed>. The license is listed
per-file and is the general OpenBSD one, and anything not documented
properly is assumed to be under the LICENSE file.
